				<li> Against the wishes of the Carporan Corporate Conglomerate sanctioned laws which have banned the use of outer planetary resource harvesting (for falsely informed “good” intentions). Zoink follows his heart and his intuition to go to Kupuuza where he is able to use his heightened awareness to travel through time in whatever space he is in and discovers a time thousands of years ago where the people of Kupuuza respectfully harvested Osirous from the Caves of Alcamina and lived in seemingly unattainable harmony for generations until the OGDF invaded and began in it’s planet wide supplementation of OBA. Having destroyed almost all remnants of Osirous across the planet, Zoink had discovered a place in the past where a small but healthy reserve of Osirous was not found and still grew to this day. </li>
