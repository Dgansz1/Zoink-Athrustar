				<li>My artistic inspiration for this piece would have to be rooted in my interest in comedy and fantasy stories and film. The story is of redemption in a dystopian galaxy, and I wanted it to be fun and silly. I decided to create a stop motion story/music video featuring a scene where my character, Zoink travels to the planet Kupuuka to search for the mythical orbs of Osirous which are secretly known to holding the power to change the neurochemical balance of all lifeforms across the universe. Zoink is trying to save his home planet from being brainwashed, because the entire galaxy is controlled by a corporation, who is fixated on profits earned through quietly enslaving an entire galaxy. Ignorance is bliss, and Zoink is on a mission to awaken an entire galaxy. </li>
