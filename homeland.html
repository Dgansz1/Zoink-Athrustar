				<li>Zoink is from Carpora, a planet on the outer rims of the Indelible galaxy, which is composed of planets Employed/Ran/Owned by the Corporate Construction company known as The OGDF: Outer-Galactic Design Firm. </li>
				<li>The OGDF has a never ending thirst to profit off of dominating the construction industry across the universe by harvesting the labor of an entire galaxy and through using cost cutting methods have created a radioactive and universally eco unfriendly trail of cosmic wreckage and somehow impossibly an extremely viral intergalactic parasitic species that can travel faster than the speed of light and is slowly infecting galaxies at an increasing rate.</li>
				<li>The people of all the planets in the Indelible galaxy are seemingly oblivious of the atrocities of their patriarchal overlords and have been brainwashed for generations through the OGDF manufactured neuro chemical, OBA (Oxcytocin Bifunctional Actuator) in their main government regulated liquid sustenance (for humans that would be water). OBA along with the other drugs the OGDF puts in their citizens drinking supply attack the Oxytocin receptors in the organisms, which are chemicals released in falling in love and redirect those chemicals towards the neurotransmitters activated during the stimulation involved with menial labor. In effect, just about all citizens in the Indelible galaxy are conditioned to do three things: Work, love the system, and reproduce to create offspring that do the same.</li>
